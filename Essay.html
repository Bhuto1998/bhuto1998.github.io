	<h2>Are we all just a simple public Appeaser?</h2>

	<p>"Are you a public appeaser?", Mr. X asked the class and there was <strong>awry</strong> silence, nobody dared to respond. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I stood up after some introspection. "No Sir I am not".</p>

	"Well, why not Arnab?", I thought I knew the answer to this question but I was wrong. As soon as I started to think again I figured out where I was wrong. I assumed that claiming not to be a public appeaser is not by itself a sign of public appeaser. Obviously, I was wrong. Any fool could have started to argue if they were in my place and most fools do, but I was too <strong>adroit</strong> for that. I slowly accepted that there was indeed an error in my thinking process and the whole class started laughing. Mr. X <strong>admonished</strong> everyone for laughing and told them they will be suspended if they repeat their action. Everyone <strong>acquiesced</strong> in his decision.

	<h2>Does Inner Mind really exists?</h2>

	<p>I personally believe in the <strong>inerrancy</strong> of my inner mind, but for most people, the inner mind is something mythical not really a scientific object.</p>
	
	I reject this viewpoint because we don't have any technology that can map our exact thoughts. Yes, we can map the region that activates when we are thinking along a particular line. This same technology shows unusually heavy activity while we are sleeping implying that we do have and actual inner mind. It is not something from storybooks. Anyone can validate the existence of the inner mind by a simple <strong>introspection</strong> of daily routines. He will notice that someone is talking with him from inside of his mind while he is checking his routines. This is just a simple exercise that helps to kindle the fire that is already within us, and it gives us a very clear vision. But as always there are some stubbornly <strong>insular</strong> human beings, who would rather stay in <strong>internment</strong> camp created by the society than accept the existence of a higher version of themselves. It is not at all futile to argue with such people as sooner or later we will hit an <strong>impasse</strong>.

	<h2>What is Mind?</h2>
	<p>For the majority of our existence, we don't think deeply about what is our minds. In one-off days when we do wonder about the massiveness and magnificence of our mind, we end up giving too much credit to one or many supernatural elements. Now I must confess, I am no Gandhi/Homer, I am very much confined by my own day to day existential struggles. </p> 

	Then what makes me different? What gives me the audacity to ask questions which many great persons before me were afraid to even talk about. I would be a liar if I claim that I know the answer to this question but I do think I know at least some part of the truth. My constant questioning, a constant search to <strong>agglomerate</strong> the function, the ins and the outs of the brain is tied to my atheistic/agonistic upbringing. It does <strong>afflict</strong> serious pain sometimes, pain which is beyond anything imaginable but my <strong>perseverance</strong> with the search always leads me to a new dimension, a completely new reality. My <strong>aide-de-camp</strong> in this painful journey is my five-point guide to which I <strong>affix</strong> the 5 most important lessons I have learned till that time point. A special feature of this guide is it is constantly changing and many times my mind "tells" me to clear out the guide and look for something new.
